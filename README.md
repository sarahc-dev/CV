A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.

## üåº Soft Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 

Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## üåü Experience

#### Makers Academy - London, Uk (March 2023 - July 2023)

Completed a 16 week highly selective, intensive bootcamp in software engineering, gaining experience in key software development principles such as OOP, TDD, SOLID, MVC and agile methodologies.

- Built full-stack applications using React, React Native, Expo, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, Ruby, Sinatra, SQL, MongoDB, various APIs (including OpenAI and The Guardian) and also implemented CI/CD using Render.
- Applied TDD practices using RSpec, Jest and Cypress, and learnt to write meaningful tests based on user requirements and acceptance criteria. 
- Worked in teams to create applications against tight deadlines, requiring teamwork and communication. Used pair-programming to problem solve efficiently, diagramming tools such as Excalidraw, and collaborative tools such as Trello, Miro, Easy Retro and GitHub. Followed agile methodologies such as stand-ups, sprints, sprint planning and retros to deliver iterations of the project.
- Learnt about Git workflow - using branches, pull requests and merging to work collaboratively, and minimise code conflicts.
- Completed the Makers emotional intelligence program - including training in empathy, feedback and communication.

- I recently attended my first Hackathon - at [Athena Hack 2023](https://www.showcode.io/athena) and I am a member of [Codebar](https://codebar.io/london).
- I love to travel and experience new things. I have embarked on two extensive solo trips - covering South East Asia, India, Nepal, China and ending with a year working in Australia (including 3 months of farm work), and another around South and Central America.
